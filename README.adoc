[[what-is-alda-tabs]]
What is alda-tabs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* _alda-tabs_ is a Domain Specific Language for guitar players.
* _alda-tabs_ is an extension of Alda to help guitar players to
"execute" their music notes in the JVM and get audio feedback.
* _alda-tabs_ is an extensible tool for music programming mainly
oriented to guitar players.

[[what-is-alda]]
What is Alda?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_alda-tabs_ is built on the top of Alda, a programming language for
music composition in the JVM.

[[is-difficult-to-learn-to-code-guitar-songs-with-alda-tabs]]
Is difficult to learn to code guitar songs with alda-tabs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

[[why]]
Why?
^^^^

* It does not require programming skills.
* It does not require traditional music notation.
* It is as straightforward as writing simple guitar sketches in a
notebook.
* You only have to copy your tabs from the paper to a text editor and
execute alda-tabs.

[[can-i-also-create-complex-digital-music-with-alda-tabs]]
Can I also create complex digital music with alda-tabs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Yes.

[[why-1]]
Why?
^^^^

* It talks to the JVM, so any experimented programmer can do impossible
things :-)
* It is just a layer on the top of Alda, so if you know music theory,
then you can write complex songs using music notation.
* With _alda-tab_ you can execute any _.alda_ file, so you can write
your songs/programs in both Clojure, Alda and alda-tabs in the same
block of text.

[[how-is-the-alda-tabs-syntax]]
How is the alda-tabs syntax?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note:* Remember that with *alda-tabs* you can always use the standard
Alda syntax and Clojure code. You can learn more about both languages
later to explore the whole potential of __alda-tabs__. But don't worry,
you don't need to know more yet. Just follow this tutorial and enjoy :)

What I am gonna show you here is the easy and super simple _alda-tabs_
syntax:

* The *tab notation*
* The *chord notation*

In 10 minutes you will be able to write songs in a text editor and
listen the result in your speakers.

[[tab-notation]]
Tab notation
------------

Imagine that you want to play all the strings of the guitar, one after
another:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/score1.png[alt
tag]

In this example, no fingers are pressed on the fret.

*So the fret number would be `0` in the six positions of the sequence.*

[[how-would-we-write-this-in-alda]]
How would we write this in Alda?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We would need to know the note equivalents of each position and:

 *  We would write the octave and the note, one after another:

....
guitar: o4 e o3 b o3 g o3 d o2 a o2 e
....

 *  Or we would write just the initial octave increasing/decreasing it
when needed:

....
guitar: o4 e/>b/g/d/<<a/e
....

[[how-to-do-it-in-alda-tabs]]
How to do it in alda-tabs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember that _alda-tabs_ is based in the simple concept of a tab.
Basically, the notes of a guitar can be defined by numeric combinations,
a number to identify the string (from the first at the bottom to the
sixth at the top) and a fret.

To write a note in _alda-tabs_ you only have to write `ta` followed by
the `string number` and the `fret number`. In other words, with
_alda-tabs_ we can write the same sequence that we have previously
expressed in Alda. But this time we don't need to know which note we are
playing, we only need to write the __tab__, the position of our finger
considering the _string_ and the __fret__:

....
 guitar: ta10 ta20 ta30 ta40 ta50 ta60
....

Basically, we are asking the JMV to play a guitar with the open strings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, one after another.

Take a look now of the fretboard:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/notes-fret.png[]

If you want to play the first note *C*, according to the graphic displayed above, you don't need to know the octave, you just will pick the second string in the first fret: `2` and `1`.
....

guitar: ta21
....

You can also modify the duration of a note adding a character at the
end. For example:

....
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

What does it mean? If you don't specify a duration, this will be whole
beat (`W`). You can also play the note during half beat (`H`), double (`D`)
and quarter (`Q`). Those note durations will be proportional to the tempo
of the score. For example, the following two sentences are not the same:

....
(tempo 100)
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

....
(tempo 300)
guitar: ta21 ta21W ta21Q ta21D ta21H
....

__Play with this combinations to see the difference__. For more complex
timing, check the _advanced tips_ bellow.

[[chord-notation]]
Chord notation
--------------

Imagine that rather than a sequence of notes you want to play a chord. A
basic example would be playing all the open strings at the same time:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/score2.png[alt
tag]

You can do this in three ways:

* In Alda syntax, using the character `/` to play the notes at the same
time:

....
guitar: o4 e/>b/g/d/<<a/e
....

* In _alta-tabs_ syntax, using the _tab notation_ with different voices:

....
guitar: V1: ta10 V2: ta20 V3: ta30 V4: ta40 V5: ta50 V6: ta60
....

* In _alta-tabs_ syntax, but using the **chord notation**:

....
guitar: (c 0 0 0 0 0 0 W)
....

As you can see, the chord notation is just a Clojure function _c_ with
seven parameters, the fret of each one of the six strings and the
duration of the chord.

For example, the D chord would be

....
(c 2 3 2 0 x x W)
....

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgrmunch/alda-tabs/master/img/re.png[alt
tag]

You can also use the _chord notation_ to play single notes. For example,
the two following sequences are exactly the same:

....
# alta-tab syntax

ta10 ta20 ta30 ta40 ta50 ta60

# alda-tab chord syntax

(c 0 x x x x x W)
(c x 0 x x x x W)
(c x x 0 x x x W)
(c x x x 0 x x W)
(c x x x x 0 x W)
(c x x x x x 0 W)
....

[[advanced-tips]]
Advanced tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can play tabs with specific durations, in seconds or milliseconds by
using the function **t**. In this case you should write the number of
the string, followed by a dot and the fret. Add the end, you should
express in String format ("") the duration you want.

....
guitar: (t 1.0 "2s") (t 2.0 "10ms") (t 2.2 "100ms")
....

You can do the same with your chords:

....
guitar: (c 0 x 1 2 2 x "5s")
....

[[how-can-i-install-alta-tabs]]
How can I install alta-tabs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Follow the https://github.com/alda-lang/alda[steps to install Alda].
*  Clone this repo and open the folder `alda-tabs` in your terminal.
*  Run the Alda server with `alda up`.

* Create a simple text file, write your song using the alda-tabs
syntax and save it.
*  Execute `./alda-tabs.sh` followed by the path of the file you want
to play.
*  Listen the result.
*  If you want to stop a song you can stop the alda server with
`alda down`.

NOTE: You can also play some scores (provided in the `/examples`
folder) and modify their content to explore different sounds.
