No.

### Why?

* It does not require programming skills.
* It does not require traditional music notation
* It is as straightforward as writing simple guitar sketches in a notebook.
* You only have to copy your tabs from the paper to a text editor and execute alda-tabs.


## Can I also create complex digital music with alda-tabs?

* Yes.

### Why?

* It talks to the JVM, so a experimented programmer can do impossible things :-)
* With *alda-tab* you can execute any *.alda* file, so you can write your songs/programs in both Clojure, Alda and alda-tabs in the same block of text.
