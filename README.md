# alda-tabs

**Execute your guitar tabs in the Java Virtual Machine**

## What is alda-tabs?

* *alda-tabs* is a programming language for guitar players.
* *alda-tabs* is an extension of Alda to help guitar players to "execute" their music notes in the JVM and get audio feedback.
* *alda-tabs* is an extensible tool for music programming mainly oriented to guitar players.

## What is Alda?

Alda is a programming language for music composition in the JVM. *alda-tabs* is built on the top of it.

## Is difficult to learn to code guitar songs with alda-tabs?

No.

### Why?

* It does not require programming skills.
* It does not require traditional music notation.
* It is as straightforward as writing simple guitar sketches in a notebook.
* You only have to copy your tabs from the paper to a text editor and execute alda-tabs.


## Can I also create complex digital music with alda-tabs?

* Yes.

### Why?

* It talks to the JVM, so any experimented programmer can do impossible things :-)
* It is just a layer on the top of Alda, so if you know music theory, then you can write complex songs using music notation.
* With *alda-tab* you can execute any *.alda* file, so you can write your songs/programs in both Clojure, Alda and alda-tabs in the same block of text.
